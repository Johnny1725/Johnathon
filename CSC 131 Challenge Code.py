 Yes, but well get to that later."

 Jessie White, we have been friends for so long and it wasn't until I met and\
 started dating my girlfriend now, Savanah, that I even started to get over her."

 bestfriends girlfriend, but also the girl that I have liked for a really long\
 time. Before they started dating we were really close and talked all of the time,\
 but she like Jessie, never kmew my true feelings and never saw me as anything more\
 than a friend."
print"   The third girl that I developed feelings for was more out of lust than\
 anything.  This was Hannah Gill, the hottest girl in school. We new each other and \
 talked, but she was always too popular to ever bother with me, until I started dating\
 Savanah."
print"   Ever since the beginning of this week I have seen all three of the girls\
 constantly and can not seem to avoid them. I feel the feelings rushing back all at once\
 and with Savanah out of town for the weekend I am going to try and avoid as much as I\
 can, to aviod unecessary drama. For some Strange reason I know that tonight I will not\
 be able to avoid them."
